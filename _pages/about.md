I am a sixth-year Ph.D. at [Dept. Of Computer Science, Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), in [DVMM lab](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/ln/dvmm/) advised by Prof. [Shih-Fu Chang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/).

My research interests focus on `Computer Vision`, `Multimodal Learning`, and `Self-supervised Learning`. Particularly, I am interested in learning representations from videos.

During my Ph.D. period, I worked on the [DARPA AIDA project](https://www.darpa.mil/program/active-interpretation-of-disparate-alternatives), which mainly focused on incorporating cross-domain knowledge (images, videos, text, and audio) for knowledge graph construction.

I am closely working with [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) and [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/jim-glass) on the Sight and Sound Project (since 2020 - ), aiming at learning representations from video and audio.

Prior to joining Columbia Univ., I finished my Bachelor and Master degrees at the Dept. of Computer Science and Information Eng., [National Taiwan University](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/), in 2015 and 2017 respectively, advised by Prof. [Shou-De Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sdlin/).
