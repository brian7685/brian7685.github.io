I am a fifth year PhD student at the [Dept. of Computer Sicence, Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), advised by Prof. [Shih-Fu Chang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/).

My research interests focuses on Computer Vision, Multimodal Learning, and Self-supervied Learning. Particularly, I am interested in learning representations from videos.

Prior to joining Columbia, I finished my Master’s and Bachelor’s at [National Taiwan University](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/), advised by [Shou-de Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sdlin/).
