I am a fifth year PhD student at the [Dept. of Computer Sicence, Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), advised by Prof. [Shih-Fu Chang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/).

My research interests focuses on `Computer Vision`, `Multimodal Learning`, and `Self-supervied Learning`. Particularly, I am interested in learning representations from videos.

During my Ph.D. period, I worked closely with [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) and [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/jim-glass) on the Sight and Sound Project (2020 - ), aiming to learn useful representations from video and audio.

Prior to joining Columbia, I finished my Master’s and Bachelor’s at [National Taiwan University](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) studing computer science, advised by [Shou-de Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sdlin/).
