I'm a senior researcher at [Samsung Research America](https://sra.samsung.com/) working on video summarization and text-to-image editing/style transfer.
Before I joined SRA, I was a visiting researcher at [Meta Reality Lab](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/)/[FAIR Embodied AI](https://ai.meta.com/). I received my Ph.D. at [Dept. Of Computer Science, Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), in [DVMM lab](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/ln/dvmm/) advised by Prof. [Shih-Fu Chang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/).

My research interests focus on `Computer Vision`, `Multimodal Learning`, and `Self-supervised Learning`. Particularly, I am interested in learning representations from videos.

In Meta, I worked on a project to develop egocentric agents on [Aria](https://www.projectaria.com/) that understand everyday tasks specified in natural language and generate goal plans for further assistance. We leverage the large language model (LLM) [LLaMA2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) and video training for zero-shot goal planning. Our model can generate future plans conditioned on the given video and input goals.

During my Ph.D. period, I worked on the [DARPA AIDA project](https://www.darpa.mil/program/active-interpretation-of-disparate-alternatives), which mainly focused on incorporating cross-domain knowledge (images, videos, text, and audio) for knowledge graph construction.

I am closely working with [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) and [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/jim-glass) on the Sight and Sound Project (since 2020 - ), aiming at learning representations from video and audio.

Prior to joining Columbia Univ., I finished my Bachelor and Master degrees at the Dept. of Computer Science and Information Eng., [National Taiwan University](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/), in 2015 and 2017 respectively, advised by Prof. [Shou-De Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sdlin/).
