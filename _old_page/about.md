I am a fifth year PhD student at the Dept. of Computer Sicence, Columbia University, advised by Prof. [Shih-Fu Chang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/).

My research interests focuses on Computer Vision, Multimodal Learning, and Self-supervied Learning. Particularly, I am interested in learning representations from videos.

Prior to joining Columbia, I finished my Master’s and Bachelor’s at National Taiwan University, advised by Shou-de Lin.
